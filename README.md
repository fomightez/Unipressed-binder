# Unipressed-binder
Unipressed examples that run in MyBinder-served sessions to illustrate use of Unipressed to query Uniprot.

-----------------------

There's a Python package, [Unipressed](https://multimeric.github.io/Unipressed/), by Michael Milton ([@multimeric](https://twitter.com/multimeric)) that allows programmatic access query UniProt's new REST API.   
If you use a launch badge on this page a Jupyter notebook will be presented where you can run work through running code to demonstrate the use of Unipressed to query Uniprot's database and get useful information related to your biological molecules of interest.

I, Wayne, am not associated with Unipressed development. For that information, see here about [Unipressed](https://multimeric.github.io/Unipressed/).    
This repo is only set up to make it convenient to try queries of Uniprot via Unipressed in MyBinder-served sessions.  
The idea is that you can then adapt these examples to your own queries and perform them without even installing anything on your own machine, provided the computational resources in the MyBinder-served session are sufficient. If not, the examples should guide you in using the code in other places or give you a place to troubleshoot with less demanding tasks.
